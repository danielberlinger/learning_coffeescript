Busy Developer's Guide: CoffeeScript

A simple project that helped me get started with a process for CoffeeScript.

Compile command from root:
  Compiles any .coffee file in src dir to lib dir
    coffee -o public/lib -cw src

If you want to run the Rack app (run from inside the project root)
  rackup file_server.ru -p 1111
  
Or you can link into Pow, or run it with any Rack compatible server.
